0102r text                         THIS IS OMEGA VERSION !!!

0402y text properly working stuff:
0502w text   - evaluating the manacost of card and playing it (if it is a creature)
0602w text   - movement feature including movement types (flying, swampwalk, ...)
0702w text   - the whole system of drawing the screen (and 'animation')
0802w text   - the Table is not flawless but pretty cool anyway

1102y text closely todo things:
1202w text   - can't play any other than creature cards
1302w text   - the fight feature was done in 2 minutes and it looks like that
1402w text   - healing, resource managing (gold, wood, food)
  
1702y text far from being ok:
1802w text   - no meaning of archery or any of 30 predefined skills yet
1902w text   - little cards defined alltogether and their values are widely nonsensable
2002w text   - all the other game concepts (buildings, landsearch, library, ...)
